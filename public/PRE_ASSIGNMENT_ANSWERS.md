# GitHub Commit Activity Comparison App

## Major Design/Build Decisions

### 1. **Choice of React:**
   I chose React due to its component-based architecture, which is well-suited for modular UI development. This decision allows for easier management of state, facilitating the dynamic nature of repository selection and data visualization.

### 2. **Recharts Library:**
   I opted for the Recharts library to handle the graph visualization. Its simplicity and flexibility for rendering charts with React components aligned well with the project's requirements.

### 3. **State Management:**
   Using React's built-in state management for simple state needs and hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for handling repository selection and data fetching. Though, I think redux is also a great choice if we think the app could grow

## Assignment Duration

The assignment took approximately +8 hours, broken down into the following buckets:

- **Learning Framework:** 3 hours (didn't fully get the time to look into Recharts and Github API as a whole)
- **Coding:** +8 hours
- **Debugging:** +8 hours

## Advice to Myself

If I could advise myself at the beginning of the project, I would recommend:

- **Thorough API Exploration:** Spend more time exploring the GitHub API to understand its nuances and capabilities better. This could help in optimizing data retrieval strategies and handling potential issues.

## Learnings

The project provided opportunities to learn:

- **GitHub API Integration:** Gained experience in integrating external APIs, specifically the GitHub API, and handling data responses.

## Showcase of Abilities

The assignment effectively allowed me to showcase:

- **React Proficiency:** Demonstrated the ability to architect a React application with dynamic components and state management.
- **API Integration:** Showcased skills in fetching and handling data from an external API.

## Unrepresented Skills

While the project showcased web development skills, some unrepresented skills include:

- **Authentication:** The project did not implement user authentication features. Proficiency in implementing authentication systems is a skill that wasn't demonstrated in this exercise.
